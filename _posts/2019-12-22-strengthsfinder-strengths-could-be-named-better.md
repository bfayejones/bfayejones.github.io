title: The 34 Clifton StrengthsFinder Strengths Could Have Been Named Much Better
---

You may have seen people who have a list of 5 "strengths" with no discernible naming scheme. Or maybe I'm the only one who was annoyed by the lack of consistency in how they named the strengths.

StrengthsFinder (Sometimes called 2.0, sometimes specified as the Clifton Strengthsfinder) is a test that tells you which of 34 supposedly scientifically valid/unique "themes" you are strongest in.

But, if they are so skilled in finding people's strengths, I would think they could have hired someone who could name the strengths well. As it is, someone's list of strengths might have "Belief", "Arranger", "Woo", "Analytical", and "Context" and they'll all sit next to each-other like they're the same type of words and not an insult to wordcraft itself. 
The reason they have to use a vague word like "themes" to discuss their categories is a direct consequence of how badly they named them.

This is all petty. It's not actually a critique yet.

But my company offers an internal professional development program. It offers a great deal of opportunity to become a better engineer and do better work when making design decisions. It takes about a year, and for the past 2 times they've opened new cohorts, the class filled up before I can enroll.

And now, finally, I managed to enroll. And this is the first year they're incorporating Strengthsfinder into the process. I can only hope that they will not be gutting too much of the great content I've heard from others who've gone through the program.

Regardless, I'm going to have to take the test, and I will be given an assortment of 5 words that don't belong together. If that's going to happen, I'm going to be as petty as I like about it.

# The 34 Clifton StrengthsFinder 2.0 themes, divided by word type.

## Verb-ers
The first category is fairly self explanatory. These strengths are all words that could describe the person with the strength.

- Achiever
- Arranger
- Activator
- Maximizer
- Developer
- Includer
- Relator
- Learner

## Adjectives
This category is a little more mixed. Almost all of these can very easily be plugged into the sentence "She is very ___", but "Futuristic" doesn't quite make it. To make the formula work for everything, I think I'd have to use the sentence "She has a very ___ way of thinking."

- Deliberative
- Restorative
- Analytical
- Futuristic
- Strategic

## Concepts
The third category is "Concepts". These are all nouns which are not people. 

One thing I hate about this problem is that a great number of the words in another categories could EASILY be turned into words that belong in this category. "Achiever" could very easily be "Achievement". "Relator" could easily be "Relation" or "Relationships". "Maximizer" could be "Maximization" or, better yet, "optimization".

This is still a mixed group of words. Most are "traits a person has" or "processes a person engages in". The main oddballs are "Harmony", "Input", and "Context". But that would be forgiveable if this was the only category. At least they are all nouns.

- Belief
- Consistency
- Discipline
- Focus
- Significance
- Self-Assurance
- Connectedness
- Competition
- Responsibility
- Communication
- Adaptability
- Empathy
- Harmony
- Individualization
- Positivity
- Ideation
- Input
- Intellection
- Context

## Ambiguous Words
This category I saved for last, because it's what I would consider "Ambiguous". "Woo" and "Command" can both be understand as verbs. "Command" can also be a thing you have, either when you specifically have command over something in a formal military sense, or when you are considered to have command over a situation as a comparison to the formal military sense. They go very far out of their way to ensure that you understand that "woo" means "Winning Others Over". However, it is never stylized as an acronym that I can see. In a set of words that all belonged in "Concepts", I would assume "Command" belonged there without thinking about it.

- Command
- Woo

# Why does this bother me so much?

The concept of "parallelism" is a basic writing principle. I spend more time writing code than English, but the experts at Grammarly explained it very well [here](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/parallelism/).

From the same page from grammarly, they use this definition:
>Parallelism in grammar is defined as two or more phrases or clauses in a sentence that have the same grammatical structure.

The reason I dislike their mis-mash of "themes" is because I want to be able to plug them into the same sentence, and you can't just replace a single noun with a single adjective.
And even if they all are nouns, it would still be hard to come up with a sentence formula that both "Harmony" and "Communication" fit into which isn't "My top CSF theme is ___".

On the other hand, whoever named them seems desperate to keep all themes to a single word. I think "Harmony cultivation" is far better than just "harmony" as the name of a strength, personally. Because saying that a person's strength is "harmony" doesn't make any sense.
